The perfect shuffle problem has to do with shuffling a deck of cards in perfect fashion. A perfect shuffle is where you have an even number of cards and you split them directly in the middle into two even decks and then insert them in a perfectly ordered fashion. For example if you had cards labeled 1 2 3 4 5 6. You would split them into 1 2 3 and 4 5 6. Then you would shuffle them into 1 4 2 5 3 6. The perfect shuffle problem in one in which you need to calculate the number of perfect shuffles required until the deck reaches the original order.
